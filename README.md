## My Nutrition App on the App Store

This app was created using SwiftUI. It's my very first app, which I developed while I was learning Swift in general. I decided to create it because nutrition is an area I'm truly passionate about, and I couldn't find an app that met my specific preferences. So, I built my own app.

I tried to give it some architecture, but working on my own without a team of more experienced people made it challenging to achieve a professional level of performance and architecture. I did my best at the time, and I hope some of you can contribute to enhancing my first born.
